  <p>After you hit submit two things occur. (1) your input is split in four shares. Each share is randomly distributed to a computing server over a secure HTTP channel. Thus each server only has a part of your data which they cannot see as it is also encrypted. (2) Your submission ID is hashed (one way hashing) and stored in our server database. This hashed value is the only information which is stored in our database. This functionality allows you to resubmit your data in case you find any errors in your input data after submission.</p>
  <div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> 2020 data submission is open between August 1, 2020 00:00 and August 31, 2020 23:59 (CET). After this date, the computing servers will perform the computation. You will be notified when the output is complete. </div>
  <div class="alert alert-info"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> This application makes use of a so called analyzer interface. This allows us to only perform the computation when sufficient participants contribute their data. The number of participants is derived from the number of hash values stored in our database.</div>
  <div class="alert alert-warning"><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> For security reasons, the output can only be downloaded from this platform. Store the completed template file you submitted on safe location. You will need this file later when the output is ready to see how you perform in comparison to other distribution centers. Without your input file you can only see how the industry as a whole performs.</div>
